## Getting Started: Local Development

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or later recommended)
- A package manager like `npm` or `yarn`

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository** (or download and unzip the code):
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-repository/formcheck-ai.git
    cd formcheck-ai
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your Environment Variables**:

    This project requires a Google Gemini API key to function.

    a. **Get an API Key**: Obtain your free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/).

    b. **Create a `.env` file**: In the root directory of the project, create a new file named `.env`.

    c. **Add your API Key**: Open the `.env` file and add the following line, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with the key you obtained from Google AI Studio:

    ```
    VITE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

    > **Important**: The `VITE_` prefix is mandatory. Modern frontend tools like Vite (which this project uses) only expose environment variables with this specific prefix to the browser to prevent accidentally leaking sensitive information.

    d. **(Security) Add to `.gitignore`**: To prevent your secret API key from being committed to version control, ensure your `.gitignore` file contains the following line:
    ```
    .env
    ```

4.  **Run the development server**:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the URL provided in your terminal) to view the application in your browser.
